# 🍷 Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Wine Quality - Red Wine dataset** sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to understand the distribution of various chemical properties of red wine and analyze their relationship with wine quality.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **File:** `winequality-red.csv`
- **Records:** 1599
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical attributes + 1 quality score

**Features include:**
- `fixed acidity`
- `volatile acidity`
- `citric acid`
- `residual sugar`
- `chlorides`
- `free sulfur dioxide`
- `total sulfur dioxide`
- `density`
- `pH`
- `sulphates`
- `alcohol`
- `quality` (target variable)

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Distribution plots for each numerical feature  
- Correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships  
- Boxplots comparing wine quality against alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, etc.

*(Screenshots or plots can be added here if desired)*

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Alcohol** has a strong positive correlation with wine quality.
- **Volatile acidity** is negatively correlated with wine quality.
- Wines with higher **sulphates** and **citric acid** tend to have better quality.
- No missing values detected in the dataset.
