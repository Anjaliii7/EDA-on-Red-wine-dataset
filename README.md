# 🍷 Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Wine Quality - Red Wine dataset** sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to understand the distribution of various chemical properties of red wine and analyze their relationship with wine quality.
